## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
# HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
# HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.


## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
# HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator

if abs(price_difference) > get_five_percent:
    get_news = requests.get(url=NEWS_ENDPOINT, params=news_parameters)
    news_data = get_news.json()['articles']
    for i in range(10):
        news_article = news_data[i]
        print(news_article['title'])
        print(news_article['description'])
        print(news_article['publishedAt'])
        print(f"Learn {news_article['url']}")

## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
# HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.


# Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
